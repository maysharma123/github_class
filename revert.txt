Hello devops team.

Once upon a time, there lived an elephant in a village. The elephant used to go to the river daily for drinking water and bathing in the river.


There was a tailor's shop on the way to the river. The tailor used to give the elephant something to eat. So the elephant  became a friend of a tailor.


One day the tailor got into a quarrel with one of his customers. He was in an angry mood because of that. That day the elephant came to his shop as usualthe.
